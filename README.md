# Battleship Game Project

This repository contains my Battleship project, an implementation of the classic Battleship game. Below is a roadmap outlining the project's objectives and the current progress:

- [x] **Ship Class/Factory:**
    - [x] Ship class with attributes: length, hits, sunk, and `isSunk()` function.

- [ ] **Gameboard Class/Factory:**
    - [ ] Ability to place ships at specific coordinates.
    - [ ] `receiveAttack` function to handle attacks and record hits or misses.
    - [ ] Tracking of missed attacks.
    - [ ] Reporting whether all ships have been sunk.

- [ ] **Player:**
    - [ ] Player class to take turns playing the game.
    - [ ] Implementation of a computer opponent capable of making random plays.

- [ ] **Main Game Loop and DOM Interaction:**
    - [ ] Creation of the game loop.
    - [ ] Implementation of the user interface.
    - [ ] Rendering gameboards and taking user input for attacking.

- [ ] **End Game Conditions:**
    - [ ] Logic to end the game when one player's ships are all sunk.

- [ ] **Finishing Touches:**
    - [ ] Options for user ship placement (e.g., coordinate input or drag and drop).
    - [ ] Enhanced computer player intelligence.
    - [ ] Optional 2-player mode for local play with mobile support.
    - [ ] HTML and UI implementation.
